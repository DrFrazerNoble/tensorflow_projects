# tensorflow_projects

Hi there!

My name is [Dr. Frazer K. Noble]() and I am a lecturer at Massey University's School of Engineering and Advanced Technology (SEAT), Albany, New Zealand.

This repository, or repo', is a collection of projects and tutorials to help get started, and work with, Google's TensorFlow (TF) machine learning framework. I intend this to be an ongoing effort, which I will update on a regular basis. I hope that it may be of use to you.

Best regards,

Frazer

P.S. If you'd like to hear about new projects and tutorials, why not follow me on Twitter with [@FrazerNoble](https://twitter.com/FrazerNoble).

# Requirements

I have used the following tools and libraries to create and run each project:

1. [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
1. [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/).
1. [Nvidia CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone).
1. [Nvidia CUDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn).
1. [Microsoft Visual Studio Code (Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
1. [Code Python Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.python).

Each project has been compiled and run on PCs running Windows 7 x64 and Windows 10 x64 to ensure they work.

Please note: if you want to use TensorFlow on a GPU, you'll need to make sure your GPU supports Nvidia's CUDA, and install CUDA and CUDNN.

# Resources

Here is a list of resources, which I think, are helpful for learning TensorFlow and machine learning:

1. [TensorFlow API Documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/). Documentation for TensorFlow.
1. [Awesome TensorFlow Projects](https://github.com/jtoy/awesome-tensorflow). A curated list of TensorFlow tutorials and projects.
1. [The 9 Deep Learning Papers you Need to Know About](https://adeshpande3.github.io/adeshpande3.github.io/The-9-Deep-Learning-Papers-You-Need-To-Know-About.html). A well written overview of the current state-of-the-art of machine learning.

Please note: the above list is not exhaustive; rather, it's more of a minimal set to get started. I'll update it once the repo' has really gotten started.

# Projects

The following is a list of projects included in this repo':

1. [getting_started](https://github.com/FKNoble/tensorflow_projects/tree/master/getting_started). This is the "Hello World!" of TensorFlow projects.
1. [Visualising a Graph](https://github.com/FKNoble/tensorflow_projects/tree/master/visualising_a_graph). This project shows you how to use TensorBoard to visualise a graph and variables.
1. [Saving and Loading a Graph](https://github.com/FKNoble/tensorflow_projects/tree/master/saving_and_loading_a_graph). This project shows you how to save and load a graph.
1. [Reading and Writing Data](https://github.com/FKNoble/tensorflow_projects/tree/master/reading_and_writing_data). This project shows you how to read and write data from and to a TFRecord. 
1. [Generic Application](). This project provides a scaffold for you to build subsequent projects on. The linear_regression, MLP, RNN, and CNN projects are all derived from the generic_application.
1. [Linear Regression](). This project shows you how linear regression can be done using TensorFlow.
1. [MLP](https://github.com/FKNoble/tensorflow_projects/tree/master/MLP). This project shows you how a Multilayered Perceptron (MLP) neural network can be implemented using TensorFlow; where, it approximates for a matematical function.
1. [RNN](https://github.com/FKNoble/tensorflow_projects/tree/master/RNN). This project shows you how a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) can be implemented using TensorFlow; where, it predicts the next number in an array of numbers.
1. [CNN](https://github.com/FKNoble/tensorflow_projects/tree/master/CNN). This project shows you how a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can be implemented using TensorFlow; wher, it learns a kernel that is convolved with an input image to give an output image.

# Tutorials

The following is a list of tutorials related to this repo':

1. [Getting Started with TensorFlow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-FF_0NAT3s). This is a video that shows how to install the tools necessary to get started with TensorFlow and write your first program.

# Installation

The following is a list of steps to follow to get started with using this repo':

1. Clone the tensorflow_projects repo'.
1. Install Anaconda and create a Python 3.5 environment for TensorFlow, e.g. 'tf' for TensorFlow running on a CPU or 'tf-gpu' for TensorFlow running on a GPU. Activate the environment and install jupyer, matplotlib, scipy, and tensorflow/tensorflow-gpu.
1. Install Code and the Python extension. 
1. Open a Windows command line and activate an environment. Type 'code' to open Code, then browse to the project's main.py.
1. Use Code's built-in console and type 'python main.py' to run the script.

At this point, everything should compile and run.

Please note: you can also run main.py from within Code by typing 'F1', then 'run' (I've made the program a Jupyter notebook).
