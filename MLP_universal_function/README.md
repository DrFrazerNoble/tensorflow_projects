# Requirements

I have used the following tools and libraries to create and run each project:

1. [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
1. [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/).
1. [Nvidia CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone).
1. [Nvidia CUDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn).
1. [Microsoft Visual Studio Code (Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
1. [Code Python Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.python).

The project has been compiled and run on PCs running Windows 7 x64 and Windows 10 x64 to ensure they work.

Please note: if you want to use TensorFlow on a GPU, you'll need to make sure your GPU supports Nvidia's CUDA, and install CUDA and CUDNN.

# Installation

The following is a list of steps to follow to get started with using this project':

1. Clone the tensorflow_projects repo'.
1. Install Anaconda and create a Python 3.5 environment for TensorFlow, e.g. 'tf' for TensorFlow running on a CPU or 'tf-gpu' for TensorFlow running on a GPU. Activate the environment and install jupyer, matplotlib, scipy, and tensorflow/tensorflow-gpu.
1. Install Code and the Python extension. 
1. Open a Windows command line and activate an environment. Type 'code' to open Code, then browse to the MLP_universal_function directory. Open main.py.
1. Use Code's built-in console and type 'python main.py' to run the script.

At this point, everything should compile and run.

Please note: you can also run main.py from within Code by typing 'F1', then 'run'.

# Usage 

To run the main.py script, browse to generic_application directory and run the following command in a command line window:

    python main.py

To run TensorBoard, run the following command and browse to 'localhost:6006':

    tensorboard --logdir=./logs
